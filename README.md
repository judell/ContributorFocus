# ContributorFocus

To review contributions to a group, enter your API token, pick a group and click Search.

You'll get a list of URLs annotated by group members.

For each URL, you'll get a list of group members who have annotated it.

Click each member's name to launch the Hypothesis client in a mode that focuses on that member's annotations and replies for the URL.

Note: You'll need to establish the selected group as the sticky default in the Hypothesis client.
